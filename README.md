Music-PlayerðŸŽ¶
This is a simple music player app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is responsive across multiple devices. It features my go-to soundtrack, showcasing songs by Tyla â€” one of my favorite artists.
Tylaâ€™s music inspires me because of her authenticity, artistry, and the way she blends global influences into something fresh and powerful. I wanted to create a player that not only lets me listen to her songs but also reflects how much her artistry motivates me.

Featuresâœ¨
-Play, pause, skip, and control tracks
-Responsive design â€“ works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
-Clean and minimal UI with confetti all over the page

Technologies UsedðŸ› 
-HTML â€“ structure of the music player
-CSS â€“ styling and layout
-JavaScript â€“ functionality and interactivity

InspirationðŸš€
This project is both a practice in front-end web development and a tribute to Tylaâ€™s artistry.                                                                                        Music and design both fuel my creativity, so combining them felt like the perfect project.

Future ImprovementsðŸ”®
